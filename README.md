# Election_Analysis2

Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project was to help Steve to do research on the stock market for several stocks over the last few years. To discover whether or not the stocks were worth investing in in the future, the process was going to complete the code script, and increase the efficiency of the original code. Then, I will be providing my analysis of the reaserch of the stock market from the year 2017 to 2018.

Results:

After completing the code, the chart shows that most of the stocks in the year 2017 were highlighted with the color green except the stock "TERP". On the other hand, in the year 2018, most of the stocks turn out to have a return value to be negative percentage except for two stocks, "ENPH" and "RUN". These two stocks perform strong growing ability throughout these years with large daily volume and positive percentage Return value.

Summary

Refactoring code in general:

In general, refactoring code could increase the efficiency of digesting each line of code. It simplifies the code for readers and computers, and it's hard to deny the benefit of refactoring. However, It will take more time for the developer to complete the script because understanding the whole image and details at the same time required decent carefulness. Developers have to make sure the code they wrote can match with the previous code, and talking to multiple lines of code would take an amount of effort. 

Refactoring VBA Script:

During this project, I found out that the biggest advantage of refactoring the VBA script was being able to see the comment from each part. It's easier to follow the script and be careful of the coding logic. On the other hand, what I know about the difference between Python and VBA is that VBA required more code to activate a function. Details are more important in the VBA script.
